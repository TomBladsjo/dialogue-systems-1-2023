Regarding part 2.3 of lab V, I think it is definitely possible to combine a confidence threshold for NLU with the one for ASR, by turning the 'threshold' state into a superstate with two substates asrThreshold and nluThreshold, where asrThreshold would be the initial state, and if the recognised utterance passed the confidence threshold it would pass to the nluThreshold, and from there to the transition state (provided it passed that threshold too). The only problem with this, which I have already noticed with the other additions I made for the past few labs, is that the more functionality I add, the more unreadable the code gets; it becomes huge and hard to overlook. I don't know if there are any good ways to solve this - I tried putting parts of the code in functions, but it seems that I can't put state nodes or actions in functions, so it only helps a little.
